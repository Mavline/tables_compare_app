# BOM Comparison Tool

## Expert Overview
As a recognized expert in BOM (Bill of Materials) systems and recipient of the IPC Apex Award for advanced documentation verification methods in the electronics industry, I present this specialized tool for Order Management Engineers.

The BOM Comparison Tool is an advanced web application that revolutionizes the way Order Management Engineers handle BOM modifications. When customers submit order changes, this tool provides a sophisticated yet user-friendly interface for comparing original and revised BOMs, ensuring precise tracking of all modifications while maintaining the integrity of hierarchical structures and component relationships.

The tool addresses critical challenges in BOM comparison:
- **Hierarchical Integrity**: Preserves Excel outline levels and grouping structures
- **Reference Designator Intelligence**: Advanced parsing and comparison of component designators
- **Change Detection Algorithm**: Sophisticated matching system for identifying modifications
- **Production-Ready Output**: Generates standardized, industry-compliant comparison reports

## Technology Foundation
- **Frontend Architecture**: React 18+ with TypeScript for robust type safety
- **State Management**: React Context API for efficient data flow
- **Routing System**: React Router for seamless navigation
- **Excel Processing Engine**: 
  - XLSX for high-performance file reading
